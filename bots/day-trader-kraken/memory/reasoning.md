# Day-Trader Bot — Reasoning

Append-only.

## 2026-04-21 15:55 day-trader-kraken close-flatten

**Saw:** Fresh paper account (created 2026-04-20) still at $100k equity and zero trades for the day. `orders open` and `positions` both empty. ITA closed 223.665, down 3.49% vs prev-day close 231.74 — broad defense weakness. No KRKNF activity in trade-log for today.

**Did:**
- Confirmed no open KRKNF orders to cancel.
- Confirmed no KRKNF position to close — already flat.
- Captured EOD snapshot: equity $100000.00, day P&L +0.00%, ITA −3.49%, bot vs bench +3.49%.
- Appended ITA row to `memory/benchmark.md`.
- Sent [KRAKEN] EOD 2026-04-21 report to ClickUp.
- Reset `memory/pattern-cache.md` to the blank template.

**Why:** Close-flatten's job is to guarantee we end the day flat and leave clean state for tomorrow's pre-market. Nothing to unwind, so the value today is the discipline of still snapshotting, still journaling, still resetting — the absence of action is itself logged so next pre-market sees an honest zero rather than an assumed zero.

**Watch:** Tomorrow's pre-market should check whether a pre-market routine is scheduled — today there was no setup cached, which suggests either the pre-market cron didn't run or the day was intentionally skipped. Also note ITA's sharp drop: if KRKNF opens gap-down in sympathy, bias toward VWAP reclaim or short ORB rather than long-side breakouts.

## Reported to ClickUp

[KRAKEN] EOD 2026-04-21
Equity: $100000.00 (today: +0.00%)
Trades: 0 (0 winners, 0 losers)  Total R: 0R
Best: none   Worst: none
Plan today: SKIP (no pre-market routine run, fresh paper account)   Adhered: yes
Notes: flat-day open with no KRKNF setup or orders; ITA -3.49% so bot outperformed bench by +3.49% by standing aside.

## 2026-04-21 08:15 day-trader-kraken pre-market (for 2026-04-22 session)

**Saw:** Account $100k equity, flat, no open orders, no KRKNF position — clean start. Then two infra blockers surfaced:
1. `GET /v2/assets/KRKNF` on the paper host returns `status: inactive, tradable: false, shortable: false`. Alpaca will reject any routed order on this symbol.
2. Market-data probe: `otc` feed → 403 Forbidden (not in our subscription). `iex` and `sip` feeds → 0 bars on both 5Min(78) and 1Day(60) requests. Snapshot returns `{}`. Control sanity-check on AAPL daily returns data normally, so keys and wrapper are fine — the gap is KRKNF-specific because it's OTC.
Catalyst scan ran anyway: Alpaca news for KRKNF is stale (latest item 2026-03-04). Finnhub company-news for 2026-04-14→21 returned 1 item, a SeekingAlpha macro piece on US-Iran / Strait of Hormuz tagged KRKNF on 2026-04-18 — not a KRKN-specific catalyst and outside the < 24h window anyway. No KRKN* in the 2026-04-21 → 2026-04-23 earnings calendar (415 entries scanned).

**Did:**
- Verified all 7 required env vars present and `ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets`, `LIVE_MODE=false` (paper-only, per CLAUDE.md rule 1).
- Pulled `account` and `positions` — both clean, no KRKNF to flatten.
- Probed multiple data feeds (iex, sip, otc, delayed_sip) and the trading-host asset endpoint to confirm the blockage is an infra/subscription issue, not a transient API hiccup.
- Overwrote `memory/pattern-cache.md` with plan=**SKIP**, all five levels marked unavailable, and a short operator-facing note explaining the two blockers and the two possible remediations (upgrade Alpaca OTC data + activate routing, or wire the TSX `KRKN` listing through a Canadian broker).
- Skipped Perplexity (the news ingest produced a clear catalyst verdict — nothing ambiguous to disambiguate — and strategy says to save those tokens).
- No ClickUp notification (pre-market is intentionally quiet per the routine's "Don't" list).

**Why:** Strategy rule: the bot will not enter a trade unless it can name a pattern AND that pattern needs ATR/VWAP/OR levels that require bar data we cannot fetch today. Separately, even a hypothetical setup can't be expressed as an order because the asset is non-tradable on this broker. When either of those is true, SKIP is mechanical; with both true, the only useful output of pre-market is the journal itself, so the operator sees the blocker and doesn't wake the 09:45 / 12:30 / 15:55 routines expecting them to make something happen.

**Watch:** If tomorrow's pre-market shows the same `inactive`/403 combo, consider recommending the operator pause the cron until the data/routing decision is made — running this routine against a dead symbol is ~3k tokens of pure overhead per day. Also: the pattern-research file's seed assumption that KRKNF liquidity is "adequate for our sizing" is true on the tape but irrelevant until Alpaca routes the symbol — update that caveat in the next weekly-review.
